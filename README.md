# em3evbms
Open-source implementation of an Android Bluetooth BMS Monitor for EM3EV batteries

* Probably compatible with most batteries whose bluetooth name starts with "DXB-".
* Currently only shows basic stats and per-cell voltages. 

The relevant code is under https://github.com/thekroko/em3evbms/tree/main/BmsMonitor/app/src/main/java/com/kroko/bmsmonitor
